/// pipeline applies uniformly without a new clamp site.

/// All other fields are straight copies from the component with no
/// per-frame transformation — the AL call site pushes them as-is.

/// AX6 extends the seam with two trailing parameters:
///   - @a listenerPosition — the camera/listener world position, needed
///     to compute the listener↔source distance the air-absorption curve
///     reads. Defaults to the origin so the dozen pre-AX6 call sites that
///     omit it keep compiling (distance from origin; the air term affects
///     only `lowPassGainHf`, which those tests do not assert).
///   - @a air — the per-frame weather snapshot. `air.enabled == false`
///     (or a 2D/non-spatial source) leaves the air term at 1.0.
///
/// `lowPassGainHf = occlusionLowPassHf × airAbsorptionHfGain`, both in
/// the linear HF-gain domain. The occlusion term is the (newly-wired)
/// HF complement of `computeObstructionLowPass`; the air term is gated
/// on `comp.spatial` (distance is meaningless for 2D sources).
///
/// AX5 adds a trailing, defaulted `lodTier`. The pure tier decision is
/// made by the caller (`AudioSystem`, which owns the per-entity
/// previous-tier state); this function just *applies* it:
///   - `Full` — no change (the default; pre-AX5 behaviour).
///   - `CheapSpatial` — skip the per-source low-pass (`lowPassGainHf` →
///     1.0); keep 3D + distance gain.
///   - `Drop2D` — collapse to 2D (`spatial` → false) at the attenuated
///     gain; no low-pass.
///   - `Mute` — gain → 0 (the source is kept alive by the apply layer).
